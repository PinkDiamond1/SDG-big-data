# SDG-big-data

This repository is comprised by three main analysis components in which we detail the use of big data as a tool for policy making based on evidence.
This work is centered around two major areas; Mobility and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
For the mobility analysis we used individual GPS records in order to characterize the behavioral response to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms on the *stay at home* mandates and social distancing recommendations. For the NLP study there are two different goals, one is to build labor market indicators from Twitter data while the other one is to understand the sentiment around news.

## GPS

We analyzed GPS data from 6 different countries to understand the differences in “stay at home” mandates for different socioeconomic groups. A summary plot of our results is displayed in the interactive chart below. The first panel represents the percentage change of the total time spent at home by socioeconomic group, the second one is the percentage change of daily users commuting to work also by socioeconomic group and the last one shows the percentage change of work commutes in the low-income group by the wealth of the neighborhood where the work is located.
