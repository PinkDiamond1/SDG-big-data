The methodology is detailed in Fraiberger et al. (2021) with an application to understanding international asset prices. 2.1 News articles Our dataset of news comes from Factiva.com. Articles are indexed using region and subject tags. Each article is annotated with topics and geographic tags generated by Factiva using a proprietary algorithm. Note that an article can be tagged with multiple locations and topics. In Fraiberger et al. (2021), we focused on English articles published by Reuters between 1991 and 2015 and tagged with either economic news or financial market news as well as with one of the 25 countries in our sample (9 AE and 16 EM). In this chapter, we provide an updated version of the news sentiment index based on Reuters articles published between 1991 and 2019. Overall, our dataset covers a wide range of economic topics (e.g. economic policy, government finance, etc.), financial topics (e.g. commodity markets, equity markets, forex, etc.), as well as corporate and political news.

To measure news sentiment, we use a bag-of-words model, allowing us to reduce complex and multi-dimensional text data into a single number. First, we combine existing lists of positive and negative words found in financial texts by Loughran and Mcdonald (2011) and in texts related to economic policy by Young and Soroka (2012). We then expand our lists by including the inflections of each word: for example, the word lose belongs to the negative list, hence we also include the words losing, loser, lost, loss, etc, leading to a final list of 7,217 negative words and 3,250 positive words. The following table shows the most frequent tonal words inour corpus. Most frequent positive (left) and negative (right) words.

For each panel, the first column reports the number of occurrences of each positive (negative) words relative to all occurrences of positive (negative) words, the second reports the fraction of articles in which the word appears, and the third column reports its inverse document frequency (IDF), which is defined below. Source: Words lists come from Loughran and Mcdonald (2011) and Young and Soroka (2012). News articles come from Factiva.com. 3.2 Country-specific news sentiment indicator Next, we define the sentiment of an article \\(j\\) as: \\[ s_{j} = \\dfrac{\\sum_{i} w_{ij} p_{ij} - \\sum_{i} w_{ij} n_{ij}}{\\sum_{i} w_{ij} t_{ij}} \\] where \\(p_{ij}\\) is the number of occurrences of positive word \\(i\\) in article \\(j\\), \\(n_{ij}\\) is the number of occurrences of negative word \\(i\\) in article \\(j\\), \\(t_{ij}\\) is the number of occurrences of word \\(i\\) in article \\(j\\), and \\(w_{ij}\\) is the weight associated with word \\(i\\) in article \\(j\\). In our baseline estimates, we take \\(w_{ij} = 1\\), allowing each word to contribute to the sentiment measure proportionally to its frequency of occurrence. In a robustness check, we let each word contribute to the sentiment measure proportionally to its Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF, Manning et al. 2008) by taking: \\[ w_{ij} = \\log\\left(\\frac{N}{N_{i}}\\right) \\] where \\(N\\) is the number of articles in the corpus and \\(N_{i}\\) is the number of articles in which word \\(i\\) is present. Hence, this weighting smoothes out differences in word frequency naturally occurring in the English language by giving more weight to words that appear more rarely across documents. It is well established that the distribution of words in the English language follows a power law. For a broader discussion on power laws in Economics, see Gabaix 2016. def get_counts(idx,data=df[&#39;full_text&#39;],tones=list(tone2keywords)): # Split into words and remove non-letter characters tokens = re.sub(&quot;[^a-zA-Z]&quot;,&quot; &quot;, data.loc[idx].lower()).split() # Return Words and Their Count counter = collections.Counter(tokens) # Word Count T = sum(counter.values()) values = [T] index = [&#39;# words&#39;] for tone in sorted(tones): # Tonal Words In the Text words = list(set(counter.keys())&amp;set(tone2keywords[tone].keys())) if words: # Tonal Words Counts counts = itemgetter(*words)(counter) # Tonal Words IDFs idfs = itemgetter(*words)(tone2keywords[tone]) if len(words) &gt; 1: tf = sum(counts)/T else: tf = counts/T tfidf = np.dot(counts,idfs)/T else: tf = 0 tfidf = 0 values.append(tf) index.append(&#39;% &#39;+tone) values.append(tfidf) index.append(&#39;% &#39;+tone+&#39; tfidf&#39;) return pd.Series(values,index=index,name=idx) To illustrate our sentiment measure, we show the example of an article in which tonal words are highlighted in bold, indicating that although our sentiment measure does not capture all of the nuances in the text, it provides a good indication of its overall tone.

Timestamp: 1996-09-02 Text: BUENOS AIRES, Sept 2 (Reuters)-The Argentine government Monday tried to counter criticisms of President Carlos Menem’s proposals for more flexible labor laws, arguing that not just workers would contribute to new unemployment insurance. Menem angered trade unions, already in disagreement over his fiscal austerity programs, by announcing a labor reform package Friday including suspending collective wage deals and replacing redundancy payouts with unemployment insurance.

Sentiment denotes our baseline measure of news sentiment. The AE and EM rows report summary statistics by country groups; the Total row reports summary statistics across all countries in our sample. Overall, we find that the the mean and the median of news indices are negative, reflecting the fact that our dictionary of tonal words contains more negative words. We also find very little difference in the properties of the indices across advanced and emerging markets, or among emerging markets. Unsurprisingly, we also find that the news sentiment index takes values that are, on average, higher in “good” times. The latter is true whether we define good times using real variables (e.g. when GDP growth is positive) or financial (strong equity market performance). Figure 3.1: Behaviour of the news sentiment index in good vs. bad times. Note: This figure reports the average and median values of the (raw) sentiment index using various definitions of good and bad times. The first two columns split the sample based on periods where a country’s real GDP growth has been positive (or negative). The third and fourth columns split the sample based on each country’s stock market index being above or below its trend, where the trend is constructed using a two-sided HP filter with a smoothing parameter of 129,600, set using the Ravn and Uhlig (2002) rule for monthly data. The last two categories split the sample based on whether the country’s daily stock market return has been positive or negative. To give more intuition about the index, we also report the behaviour of the news sentiment index around key economic and financial events. We first plot the daily news sentiment index around equity crisis (left) and booms (right); where we define crisis or booms as daily variations of the local equity index greater than 3 standard deviation (on either side). As expected, we find that news sentiment collapses (or improves drastically) around equity busts (booms). Figure 3.2: Sentiment indices around equity crisis (left) and booms (left) We also zoom in on specific events that occurred in advanced and emerging markets. We report the behaviour of the US sentiment index around September 15, 2018 when Lehman brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (left), and the behaviour of the China sentiment index around June 13, 2015 when the China’s stock market bubble popped (right). In both cases, we also find that the news sentiment index tracks closely those events and reacts as expected.

Local news is tagged with only one country and isolates local news from country-specific news articles. A typical local article is the one discussing labor market laws in Argentina reported above. A typical multi-country article is one reported below, entitled “Fears of Brazilian devaluation hit emerging markets.” The article mentions multiple countries and their interrelations: Title: Fears of Brazilian devaluation hit emerging markets Timestamp: 1998-09-11 Text: LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters)—Emerging market currencies braced for further knocks on Friday amid fears that Brazil might give in to devaluation pressure and unleash a fresh onslaught around the globe. The rouble continued to gain ground in thin trade amid hopes of an imminent end to Russia’s political deadlock. But the Hungarian forint and Polish zloty slid on global bearishness after Thursday’s huge stock market falls in Latin America. Most Asian currencies held steady, helped by the firmer yen as the dollar sagged on President Bill Clinton’s political woes and speculation about an impending U.S. interest rate cut. The Indonesian rupiah rebounded from Thursday’s sharp fall. With the market discounting the near-certainty that Russia’s parliament would approve Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister later on Friday, attention focused mainly on whether Brazilian markets would see another hammering after Thursday’s collapse. “It’s like a tidal wave waiting offshore, and everybody’s hoping it’ll go in the other direction. If it hits Rio it’ll hit everywhere else,” said Nigel Rendell, an emerging markets strategist at Santander Investment Bank in London. A huge exodus of dollars on Thursday from Brazil’s foreign exchange markets, estimated at over $2 billion, panicked the key Sao Paulo stock market into a plunge of nearly 16 percent, its biggest one-day drop for nearly 11 years. The rout sparked similar slides across the region and fed general fears of a world economic slowdown, prompting steep market falls in Japan and Hong Kong early on Friday. Latin American currencies are little traded in London, and analysts said the market was waiting for direction from Wall Street’s opening and the start of New York currency trade. As an early indication of sentiment, the region’s most liquid unit, the Mexican peso, lost further ground from New York’s closing levels. By 1215 GMT it was 10.65 bid to the dollar, just off Thursday’s historic low of 10.685. Brazil, heavily dependent on capital inflows to support a pronounced short- term debt burden, has come under particular pressure from the flight investment capital from emerging markets. The central bank hiked its key interest rate overnight by 20 points to nearly 50 percent to try to halt the massive outflows. Analysts say it is touch and go whether Brazil will devalue the real before presidential elections on October 4, although officials have repeatedly denied devaluation is on the cards. “It does think it is likely. The only question is whether it will come before or after the election,” said David Boren, an emerging market strategist at Daiwa Europe in London. Analysts say Brazil still has enough reserves—now around $50 billion—to continue propping up the real but delaying what many see as the inevitable may leave the country financially depleted and less able to engineer an orderly devaluation in uncertain global market conditions. If Brazil devalues, it will almost certainly spark a fresh wave of pressure on emerging market currencies worldwide. Analysts said Argentina would be among the first in line, although the country had sufficient reserves in relation to its money supply to defend its currency board system. “With market focus on possible devaluations in Latam, China’s currency stance may again come under market scrutiny,” Standard Chartered Bank said on Friday in a note to clients. China has vowed not to devalue, and news on Thursday of a 23 percent rise in the country’s trade surplus in the first eight months of the year eased selling pressure on the yuan to the extent that the central bank was spotted buying dollars. Analysts said Hong Kong’s currency board would also come under more pressure if the real fell. Other potential victims included South Africa and even the stronger Central European countries such as Poland and Hungary, possibly forcing Budapest to widen its 4.5 percent wide trading band for the forint. The forint was glued with to the bottom of its target band on Friday. The zloty also swung sharply lower and was was quoted only 1.31/1.03 percent above its target basket parity at 1215 GMT, compared with Thursday’s fixing of 3.97 percent above parity. The rouble firmed to around 10.5 bid to the dollar from late Thursday levels of 12.5, buoyed partly by hopes of some political stability. But volume remained very thin, and analysts said the rally was unlikely to last as the new government looked set to print money to clear wage and pension arrears. FOREX MARKET SNAPSHOT.

Specifically, we recompute the sentiment index of each country after excluding any article mentioning any other country. Applying this filter allows us to capture the sentiment of purely local news. insheet using &quot;..\\..\\replication\\data\\features-1991-1996-missing-countries.csv&quot;, comma clear compress drop v1 tempfile _tmp save `_tmp&#39; insheet using &quot;..\\..\\replication\\data\\news.csv&quot;, comma clear compress d append using `_tmp&#39;, gen(source) * Tags of topic-specific articles cap ren *commodity* *commdty* cap ren *monetary* *money* cap ren *external* *extrnl* cap ren *political* *polit* cap ren *general* *gen* cap ren *policy* *pol* cap ren *performance* *perform* cap ren *corporate* *corp* cap ren *derivative* *deriv* cap ren *market* *mkt* cap ren *economic* *ecn* cap ren *government* *govt* cap ren *indicators* *ind* cap ren *financial* *fin* cap ren *payments* *pay* cap ren *securities* *scrty* cap ren *industrial* *indl* cap ren *forex* *fx* cap ren *pay* ** cap ren *mkts* *mkt* cap ren *bond* ** cap ren *perform* ** cap ren *commdty* *comm* cap ren *finance* *fin* * Local baseline sentiment excluding topics with no signal gen sentiment_local = positive - negative if local==1 &amp; /// !(table==1 | tables==1 | tradeextrnl==1 | ecnind==1 | debtmkt==1) gen n_articles_local = (words!=0) &amp; local==1 &amp; /// !(table==1 | tables==1 | tradeextrnl==1 | ecnind==1 | debtmkt==1) ren date str_date gen date = date(str_date, &quot;YMD&quot;, 2000), after(str_date) format date %tdnn/dd/CCYY keep country date sentiment* n_articles* collapse (mean) sentiment* (sum) n_articles*, by(country date) compress gen iso2 = &quot;&quot;, after(country) replace iso2 = &quot;AR&quot; if country==&quot;Argentina&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;BR&quot; if country==&quot;Brazil&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;CL&quot; if country==&quot;Chile&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;CN&quot; if country==&quot;China&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;FR&quot; if country==&quot;France&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;DE&quot; if country==&quot;Germany&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;GR&quot; if country==&quot;Greece&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;IN&quot; if country==&quot;India&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;ID&quot; if country==&quot;Indonesia&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;IE&quot; if country==&quot;Ireland&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;IT&quot; if country==&quot;Italy&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;JP&quot; if country==&quot;Japan&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;KR&quot; if country==&quot;Korea&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;MY&quot; if country==&quot;Malaysia&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;MX&quot; if country==&quot;Mexico&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;PE&quot; if country==&quot;Peru&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;PH&quot; if country==&quot;Philippines&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;PL&quot; if country==&quot;Poland&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;PT&quot; if country==&quot;Portugal&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;RU&quot; if country==&quot;Russia&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;ZA&quot; if country==&quot;South Africa&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;KR&quot; if country==&quot;South Korea&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;ES&quot; if country==&quot;Spain&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;TH&quot; if country==&quot;Thailand&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;TR&quot; if country==&quot;Turkey&quot; replace iso2 = &quot;US&quot; if country==&quot;United States&quot; tab iso2, m * Convert to z-scores within each country ds sentiment* foreach vv in `r(varlist)&#39; { bys iso2: egen _mean = mean(`vv&#39;) bys iso2: egen _sd = sd(`vv&#39;) replace `vv&#39; = (`vv&#39; - _mean) / _sd drop _mean _sd } compress d save &quot;..\\indicator\\sentiment_local.dta&quot;, replace 4.2 Global news sentiment indicator Global news sentiment index captures the tone of news published in the world every day. We extract a common factor from our country-specific sentiment series using a Kalman filter. Formally, we estimate a single (latent) factor model in the spirit of Stock and Watson (2016). \\[\\begin{align*} S_{i,t} &amp;= P_{i} F_{t} + u_{i,t} \\\\ F_{t} &amp;= A_{1} F_{t-1} + A_{2} F_{t-2} + \\dots + v_{t} \\\\ u_{i,t} &amp;= C_{1} u_{i,t-1} + C_{2} u_{i,t-2} + \\dots + e_{i,t}, \\end{align*}\\] where \\(S_{i,t}\\) refers to the news sentiment index in country \\(i\\) on day \\(t\\), \\(F_{t}\\) is the (unobserved) global news sentiment factor at time \\(t\\), and \\(P_{i}\\) is the country-specific factor loading. We use an AR(8) for the factor structure and estimate the model using Maximum Likelihood. The data coverage for news articles does not start at the same time for all countries. In order to ensure that all countries in our sample have the longest time coverage, we impute these missing observations with zeroes when we estimate the factor model to extract the global news sentiment. use &quot;..\\indicator\\sentiment_country.dta&quot;, clear keep iso2 date sentiment_country reshape wide sentiment_country, i(date) j(iso2) string tsset date tsfill keep if year(date) &gt; 1990 ds sentiment_country* loc vlist = &quot;`r(varlist)&#39;&quot; foreach vv in `vlist&#39; { di &quot;replace `vv&#39; = 0 if mi(`vv&#39;)&quot; replace `vv&#39; = 0 if mi(`vv&#39;) } compress dfactor ((`vlist&#39;) = , noconstant) (f = , ar(1/8)) ereturn list predict sentiment_global if e(sample), factor smethod(filter) * Convert to z-scores ds sentiment* foreach vv in `r(varlist)&#39; { bys iso2: egen _mean = mean(`vv&#39;) bys iso2: egen _sd = sd(`vv&#39;) replace `vv&#39; = (`vv&#39; - _mean) / _sd drop _mean _sd } compress save &quot;..\\indicator\\sentiment_global.dta&quot;, replace "],["labor-market-analysis-with-twitter-data.html", "Chapter 5 Labor market analysis with Twitter data", " Chapter 5 Labor market analysis with Twitter data Online social networks, such as Twitter, play a key role in the diffusion of information on jobs. For instance, companies and job aggregators post job offers while users disclose their labor market situation seeking emotional support or new job opportunities through their online network. In this context, Twitter data can be seen as a complementary data source to official statistics as it provides timely information about labor market trends. In this project, we leverage state-of-the-art language models (Devlin et al, 2018) to accurately identify disclosures on personal labor market situations as well as job offers. The methodology is presented in this IC2S2 2020 presentation and detailed in Tonneau et al. (2021) (add link). Aggregating this individual information at the city and country levels, we then built Twitter-based labor market indexes and used them to better predict future labor market trends.
